# TanksGame
Implementation of a tanks game for two players where the objective is to destroy the tank of the other player. The game counts with obstacles represented as boxes, the first tank is moved with the keys: a, s, d and w and shoots a bullet with the key "j" and the second tank is moved with the arrows and shoots a bullet with the key "enter". The bullets have a limit, after some distance they dissapear and when hits an obstacle this one is destroyed. A player wins when one bullet hits the tank of the other player.

The shell library was used to implement this game.
